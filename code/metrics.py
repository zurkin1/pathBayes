#Special accuracy function for clustering.
def acc(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculate clustering accuracy. This acc function calculates clustering accuracy, which is a measure of how well a clustering algorithm assigns
    data points to clusters compared to the ground truth labels. It does so by finding the best matching between the predicted cluster assignments
    (y_pred) and the true labels (y_true), and then calculating the accuracy based on this matching. Here's how the function works:
    1. It first ensures that both y_true and y_pred are integer arrays.
    2. It asserts that the sizes of y_true and y_pred are equal.
    3. It initializes a confusion matrix w where each entry w[i, j] denotes the number of data points that belong to cluster i according to y_pred
       and to cluster j according to y_true.
    4. It computes the optimal one-to-one matching between the predicted clusters and the true clusters using the Hungarian algorithm, implemented
       in linear_assignment from scikit-learn.
    5. It calculates the accuracy by summing the values of the confusion matrix corresponding to the optimal matching and dividing by the total 
       number of data points.
    6. This accuracy measure is specifically tailored for clustering algorithms, where there is no inherent ordering of cluster labels. It 
       accounts for the fact that clusters may be assigned arbitrary labels by the algorithm, and it finds the best matching between these labels and the true labels to compute accuracy.

    Traditional accuracy metrics assume a one-to-one correspondence between predicted and true labels, which is not the case in clustering. 
    Instead, the acc function finds the best matching between clusters and true labels, providing a more appropriate measure of clustering 
    performance. We need to find the best matching between the predicted clusters and the true clusters and then evaluate the performance based on
    this matching. This is what the acc function does by finding the optimal matching using the Hungarian algorithm and computing the accuracy
    based on this matching.
